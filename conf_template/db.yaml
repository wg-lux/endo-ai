# password_file specifies the path to a file containing the database password.
# This path should be relative to the project's root directory (where devenv.nix resides).
# The env_setup.py script will create this file with a default password
# if it doesn't exist during environment initialization (`devenv tasks run env:build`).
# Ensure the file contains only the password string.
# Example: /home/admin/dev/endo-ai/conf/db_pwd
